                One of my notable projects is this very Portfolio Website that you are exploring now.
                <br>
                Constructed primarily using HTML and CSS for building and designing and some scripts to enhance it's appeal.

                In my 6th semester, I worked on a project where I created a webpage to calculate the busfare of bus stops along the ringroad of Kathmandu Valley. 
                The project required users to first sign up and then login to access the platform's features.
                Once logged in, users could select their pickup and destination points from convenient dropdown menus, fill in necessary details and 
                calculate the total distance between the source and destination to determine the fare. The total distance and the fare required, both are displayed. 
                <br><br>
                The project was crafted using HTML and CSS for designing and styling. The Project also utilized JavaScript for implementing dynamic functionalities such as form validation,
                distance calculation and user interaction. For the backend database, I used MongoDB to store the user information securely (Email and Passwords) for signup
                and login functionalities. Through this a user can sign up and login only with the information already stored into the database.
                <br>
                This project helped me learn more about Web Development and database.

                In 4th semester, I projected a webpage named E'NOTES aimed at providing users with access to view, read and download the notes of each subject of each semester and 
                of every faculty (BE Computer, BE IT andd BE Civil).
                Aditionally, the personnels with the authorized information can login to upload, update and delete the necessary files to the platform. 
                <br> <br>
                I used HTML and CSS for crafting the project offereing a user-friendly interface for seamless navigation. 
                The Project also utilized PHP for implementing dynamic functionalities, E'NOTES enabled users to interact with the platform effectively. 
                MySQL was employed as backend database to store and manage the data, while XAMPP as the server to host the project.
                <br><br>
                I learned about web development and HTML and CSS through this project. Aditionally,I learned more about how the datas are stored into the database using MySQL. 
                This hands-on experience provieded me with a comprehensive understanding of database management and how websites work behind the scenes.
